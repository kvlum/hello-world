First Repository  
My first change to my first repository.  

To add new lines, put two spaces at the end of the file.  
Inconvienent!  

How do I undo changes?
I can't find any place to undo changes.  
In Google Drive, you can easily revert changes.  
But in Github, you can't undo changes!  
Very inconvienent!

I just forgot to put two spaces in front of the end of the line!  
This is why I prefer other editors that don't require me to put two spaces at the end of a line just to make the line appear!  
It should just be simply typing the enter key.  
But no, I have to do more work and potentially forget to add a new line.  
Yuck.
